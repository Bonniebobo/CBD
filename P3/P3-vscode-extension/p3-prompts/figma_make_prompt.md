We are building an extension for VS code, the extension is like cursor, a chatbot that help user to code
here are our user stories:
As a developer, I want AI to have awareness of my entire folder (repo) of code, so that I can ask AI for a repo summary or change code without needing to manually append context.
As a developer, I want the AI to generate multiple related code files at once so that I do not need to manually stitch files together.
As a developer, I want the AI’s repo summaries to include direct code files or line citations so that I can better check explanations and quickly verify them in context.

I'll create a VS Code extension interface prototype that demonstrates your AI coding assistant features. This will include a VS Code-like layout with a file explorer, code editor, and chat interface to showcase repo awareness, multi-file generation, and code citations.

I've created a comprehensive VS Code extension prototype that demonstrates your AI coding assistant features. The interface includes a file explorer sidebar, code editor, AI chat interface, and status bar that showcases repository awareness, multi-file generation capabilities, and code citations with line references.

The prototype demonstrates all three key user stories: repository-wide context awareness through the indexed file count and AI responses, multi-file generation shown in the chat with file badges, and direct code citations with file names and line numbers for easy verification. You can interact with the file explorer to select different files and see how the AI maintains context awareness throughout the conversation.

• Try selecting different files from the sidebar to see the code editor in action
• Use the chat interface to ask about repository summaries or request code generation
• Notice the status indicators showing AI readiness and repository indexing status

I want to put the hyperlink that can refer back to the code in summery text, not seperate from the text in a independent section

AI
I'll modify the ChatInterface to embed clickable hyperlinks directly within the summary text instead of showing citations as a separate section.

Perfect! I've updated the ChatInterface to embed clickable hyperlinks directly within the summary text instead of showing citations as a separate section. Now when the AI references code files, they appear as inline clickable links like `Header.tsx:4` that users can click to jump directly to that file.

The key changes include a new `MessageContent` component that parses markdown-style links in the AI responses, making file references clickable within the text flow. Generated files in the badges are also now clickable, and all links connect back to the file selection system to provide seamless navigation between the AI conversation and code exploration.

• Click any blue file reference links in the AI messages to jump to that file
• The file badges for generated files are now also clickable  
• All code references are now integrated naturally into the conversation flow

User
you can do something like , after each line, we have a hyperlink like this ui button, when user click, they will be redirect to the code, or they can see the list can choose to click one of them

AI
I'll add clickable file reference buttons that appear after each line with code references, similar to the file tab design you showed. Users can click these to jump to specific files or see a list of all references.

Perfect! I've updated the chat interface to include clickable file reference buttons that appear after each line containing code references. The implementation includes:

Line-level file buttons: Small clickable buttons appear directly after lines that reference specific files, styled like file tabs with a document icon and filename.

Comprehensive file list: When multiple files are referenced in a message, an "All Referenced Files" section appears at the bottom with all clickable file references for easy navigation.

Visual hierarchy: Line-specific buttons use a subtle muted background, while the comprehensive list uses primary-colored buttons to distinguish between immediate context and overall references.

• Try typing "explain" or "create" in the chat to see the new file reference buttons in action
• Click any file button to jump directly to that file in the editor
• Notice how each line with code references now has its own set of clickable file tabs

i dont want the ** here, also the bottom part seems a little redundent

AI
I'll remove the markdown formatting (**) and eliminate the redundant "All Referenced Files" section at the bottom to clean up the interface.

Perfect! I've cleaned up the chat interface by removing the markdown formatting (**) from all the text content and eliminating the redundant "All Referenced Files" section at the bottom. Now the interface is much cleaner with just the inline file reference buttons appearing after each relevant line, exactly like you showed in the image.

The changes include clean text without bold formatting and streamlined file references with only the line-specific clickable buttons, removing the repetitive bottom section that was showing all files again.

User
This is per file citation, we would prefer the citation to lines

AI
I'll update the citation system to show line-level references instead of just file-level ones, making the citations more specific and useful for navigation.

Perfect! I've updated the citation system to show line-level references instead of just file-level ones. The changes include:

Line-specific citations: Each citation button now shows the filename with the specific line number (e.g., "App.tsx:10") where the reference occurs, making it much more precise for navigation.

Enhanced mock data: Updated all the AI responses to include realistic line number references that developers would actually find useful, like specific function definitions, import statements, and variable declarations.

Improved button display: The citation buttons now clearly show both the file and line number, with the line number styled in a subtle muted color to maintain readability while providing the precise location information.

Now when you interact with the chat, you'll see much more specific references like "useState for selectedFile:10" or "main App function:9" that pinpoint exactly where in the code each reference is located.

User
now it only has the line, but when i click, it won't jump to the line we are refering to, do you have a better solution to solve this

AI
You're absolutely right! The current implementation only opens the file but doesn't jump to the specific line. Let me enhance the system to actually navigate to the referenced line number when clicking the citation buttons.

Now I'll update the system to support line-level navigation. I'll modify the App component to handle line numbers, update the ChatInterface to pass line numbers, and enhance the CodeEditor to scroll to specific lines.

Perfect! Now I need to update the Sidebar interface and make sure the file selection calls don't pass line numbers from the sidebar (since that's for browsing files, not citations).

Perfect! Now I've implemented a complete line-level navigation system. Here's what I've added:

Enhanced Navigation System: The app now supports both file and line-level navigation. When you click a citation button that includes a line number, it will open the file and automatically scroll to and highlight that specific line.


Visual Line Highlighting: The selected line gets a subtle background highlight in both the line number column and the code editor, with a smooth fade-out animation after 3 seconds.



Smooth Scrolling: The editor automatically scrolls to center the referenced line in the viewport for optimal visibility.



Backward Compatibility: Regular file selection from the sidebar still works as before (without line numbers), while citation buttons now properly pass line numbers for precise navigation.



Now when you click on citation buttons like "useState for selectedFile:10" or "main App function:9", the system will open the file and jump directly to that line, making the AI's code references much more actionable and useful for developers.
